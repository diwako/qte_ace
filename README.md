# Quick time events for ACE3 actions

## Summary

Provides QTE events for ACE interactions, mostly for actions that have a progress bar. The goal is to allow people with quick fingers to wait less. \
This means if you ignore the QTEs or disable it, you wait the same amount as you'd normally would with ACE, but if you solve the QTE before the time runs out, you are technically faster than the normal wait time.
